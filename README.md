Data Insertion: Inserts the collected data into the MySQL database tables.
Reporting: Provides various queries to extract insights from the stored data, such as most viewed videos, channels with the most videos, and average video duration per channel.
User Interface: Streamlit is used to create a simple user interface to interact with the data and run predefined queries.
